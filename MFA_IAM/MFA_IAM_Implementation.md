# Multi-Factor Authentication & IAM Implementation

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA enhances security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors:
- Password
- OTP / Authenticator app
- Biometric (optional)

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
IAM controls who can access what resources and under what conditions.

## Implementation Steps
1. Integrate MFA with VPN login
2. Configure IAM roles
3. Apply least privilege principle
4. Monitor authentication logs

## Benefits
- Prevents credential-based attacks
- Improves access control
- Enhances accountability
