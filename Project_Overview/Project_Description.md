# Project Description – Secure Remote Access Solution

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a secure remote access solution for employees working from home or while traveling. Remote access introduces multiple security risks such as unauthorized access, data leakage, and malware infections. This project addresses these risks using industry-standard security controls.

## Problem Statement
Organizations require secure access to internal resources without exposing sensitive systems to cyber threats. Traditional remote access solutions often lack strong authentication, endpoint validation, and continuous monitoring.

## Solution Summary
The proposed solution uses:
- Secure VPN technologies (IPSec & SSL/TLS)
- Strong encryption (AES-256)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Endpoint security enforcement
- Zero Trust Architecture
- Centralized monitoring and logging

## Key Benefits
- Secure remote connectivity
- Reduced attack surface
- Improved visibility into remote user activities
- Compliance with security standards
